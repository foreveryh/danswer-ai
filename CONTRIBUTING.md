# Contributing to Onyx

Hey there! We are so excited that you're interested in Onyx.

As an open source project in a rapidly changing space, we welcome all contributions.

## üíÉ Guidelines

### Contribution Opportunities

The [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/onyx-dot-app/onyx/issues) page is a great place to start for contribution ideas.

To ensure that your contribution is aligned with the project's direction, please reach out to Hagen (or any other maintainer) on the Onyx team
via [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/onyx-dot-app/shared_invite/zt-2twesxdr6-5iQitKZQpgq~hYIZ~dv3KA) /

We would love to see you there!

## Get Started üöÄ

Onyx being a fully functional app, relies on some external software, specifically:

- [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) (Relational DB)
- [Vespa](https://vespa.ai/) (Vector DB/Search Engine)
- [Redis](https://redis.io/) (Cache)
- [Nginx](https://nginx.org/) (Not needed for development flows generally)

> **Note:**
> This guide provides instructions to build and run Onyx locally from source with Docker containers providing the above external software. We believe this combination is easier for
> development purposes. If you prefer to use pre-built container images, we provide instructions on running the full Onyx stack within Docker below.

### Local Set Up

Be sure to use Python version 3.11. For instructions on installing Python 3.11 on macOS, refer to the [CONTRIBUTING_MACOS.md](./CONTRIBUTING_MACOS.md) readme.

If using a lower version, modifications will have to be made to the code.
If using a higher version, sometimes some libraries will not be available (i.e. we had problems with Tensorflow in the past with higher versions of python).

#### Backend: Python requirements

Currently, we use pip and recommend creating a virtual environment.

For convenience here's a command for it:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

> **Note:**
> This virtual environment MUST NOT be set up WITHIN the onyx directory if you plan on using mypy within certain IDEs.
> For simplicity, we recommend setting up the virtual environment outside of the onyx directory.

_For Windows, activate the virtual environment using Command Prompt:_

```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

If using PowerShell, the command slightly differs:

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

Install the required python dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r onyx/backend/requirements/default.txt
pip install -r onyx/backend/requirements/dev.txt
pip install -r onyx/backend/requirements/ee.txt
pip install -r onyx/backend/requirements/model_server.txt
```

Install Playwright for Python (headless browser required by the Web Connector)

In the activated Python virtualenv, install Playwright for Python by running:

```bash
playwright install
```

You may have to deactivate and reactivate your virtualenv for `playwright` to appear on your path.

#### Frontend: Node dependencies

Install [Node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) for the frontend.
Once the above is done, navigate to `onyx/web` run:

```bash
npm i
```

## Formatting and Linting

### Backend

For the backend, you'll need to setup pre-commit hooks (black / reorder-python-imports).
First, install pre-commit (if you don't have it already) following the instructions
[here](https://pre-commit.com/#installation).

With the virtual environment active, install the pre-commit library with:

```bash
pip install pre-commit
```

Then, from the `onyx/backend` directory, run:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

Additionally, we use `mypy` for static type checking.
Onyx is fully type-annotated, and we want to keep it that way!
To run the mypy checks manually, run `python -m mypy .` from the `onyx/backend` directory.

### Web

We use `prettier` for formatting. The desired version (2.8.8) will be installed via a `npm i` from the `onyx/web` directory.
To run the formatter, use `npx prettier --write .` from the `onyx/web` directory.
Please double check that prettier passes before creating a pull request.

# Running the application for development

## Developing using VSCode Debugger (recommended)

We highly recommend using VSCode debugger for development.
See [CONTRIBUTING_VSCODE.md](./CONTRIBUTING_VSCODE.md) for more details.

Otherwise, you can follow the instructions below to run the application for development.

## Manually running the application for development
### Docker containers for external software

You will need Docker installed to run these containers.

First navigate to `onyx/deployment/docker_compose`, then start up Postgres/Vespa/Redis with:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml -p onyx-stack up -d index relational_db cache
```

(index refers to Vespa, relational_db refers to Postgres, and cache refers to Redis)

### Running Onyx locally

To start the frontend, navigate to `onyx/web` and run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Next, start the model server which runs the local NLP models.
Navigate to `onyx/backend` and run:

```bash
uvicorn model_server.main:app --reload --port 9000
```

_For Windows (for compatibility with both PowerShell and Command Prompt):_

```bash
powershell -Command "uvicorn model_server.main:app --reload --port 9000"
```

The first time running Onyx, you will need to run the DB migrations for Postgres.
After the first time, this is no longer required unless the DB models change.

Navigate to `onyx/backend` and with the venv active, run:

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

Next, start the task queue which orchestrates the background jobs.
Jobs that take more time are run async from the API server.

Still in `onyx/backend`, run:

```bash
python ./scripts/dev_run_background_jobs.py
```

To run the backend API server, navigate back to `onyx/backend` and run:

```bash
AUTH_TYPE=disabled uvicorn onyx.main:app --reload --port 8080
```

_For Windows (for compatibility with both PowerShell and Command Prompt):_

```bash
powershell -Command "
    $env:AUTH_TYPE='disabled'
    uvicorn onyx.main:app --reload --port 8080
"
```

> **Note:**
> If you need finer logging, add the additional environment variable `LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` to the relevant services.

#### Wrapping up

You should now have 4 servers running:

- Web server
- Backend API
- Model server
- Background jobs

Now, visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser. You should see the Onyx onboarding wizard where you can connect your external LLM provider to Onyx.

You've successfully set up a local Onyx instance! üèÅ

#### Running the Onyx application in a container

You can run the full Onyx application stack from pre-built images including all external software dependencies.

Navigate to `onyx/deployment/docker_compose` and run:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml -p onyx-stack up -d
```

After Docker pulls and starts these containers, navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to use Onyx.

If you want to make changes to Onyx and run those changes in Docker, you can also build a local version of the Onyx container images that incorporates your changes like so:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml -p onyx-stack up -d --build
```


### Release Process

Onyx loosely follows the SemVer versioning standard.
Major changes are released with a "minor" version bump. Currently we use patch release versions to indicate small feature changes.
A set of Docker containers will be pushed automatically to DockerHub with every tag.
You can see the containers [here](https://hub.docker.com/search?q=onyx%2F).
