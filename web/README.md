This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Install node / npm: https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm
Install all dependencies: `npm i`

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

_Note:_ if you are having problems accessing the ^, try setting the `WEB_DOMAIN` env variable to
`http://127.0.0.1:3000` and accessing it there.

## Testing
This testing process will reset your application into a clean state. 
Don't run these tests if you don't want to do this!

Bring up the entire application.


1. Reset the instance

```cd backend
export PYTEST_IGNORE_SKIP=true
pytest -s tests/integration/tests/playwright/test_playwright.py
```

2. Run playwright

```
cd web
npx playwright test
```

3. Inspect results

By default, playwright.config.ts is configured to output the results to:

```
web/test-results
```

4. Upload results to Chromatic (Optional)

This step would normally not be run by third party developers, but first party devs
may use this for local troubleshooting and testing.

```
cd web
npx chromatic --playwright --project-token={your token here}
```
